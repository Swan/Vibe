# Vibe
A Discord Bot specifically for the Vibro Enthusiast Club

# Usage
Running the bot is fairly simple. I don't know why you would, since it's for personal use, but here you go anyway.

* Clone the repository
* In `config.json` fill out the appropriate details
* In `tracking.json` fill out the user ids of the users you'd like to track.
* run `npm install`
* run`node app.js`
