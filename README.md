# Vibe
A Discord Bot specifically for the Vibro Enthusiast Club. Used mainly for score tracking.

# Usage
Running the bot is fairly simple. I don't know why you would, since it's for personal use, but here you go anyway.

* Clone the repository
* In `config.json` fill out the appropriate details
* run `npm install`
* run`npm start`
